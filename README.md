# Personal Site
This site is used as both a visibility tool for prospective employers as well as a place to put my personal blog, in which I only have a few old posts as of now.

If I get too many more pages, I will want to use or write a quick little static site generator to cut down on redundancy and make everything a bit more maintainable.
